Test the functionality of the SWE Copilot Kit to ensure all features are working as expected. This includes verifying that the agents, prompts, skills, and tools operate correctly in various scenarios. Provide detailed feedback on any issues encountered and suggest improvements where applicable.

Verify unit test as well.

Use a temporary directory `sck-test-workspace` to test if needed. Clean up any temporary files or configurations created during testing.
