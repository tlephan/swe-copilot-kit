Update the Table of Contents (TOC) in the README.md or any markdown document to reflect recent changes in the document structure. Ensure that all new sections and subsections are included, and any removed sections are deleted from the TOC. Maintain proper indentation and formatting for nested items in the TOC.

If the document does not have a TOC, create one at the beginning of the document after the title.
